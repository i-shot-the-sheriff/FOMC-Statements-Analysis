### About the Project
This repository contains our final work for the **Machine-learning for Portfolio Management and Trading** course at **ENSAE**, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

In this repository, you will find the following files:
* The notebook **eda.ipynb**, which contains code for exploratory data analysis on this original dataset.
* The notebook **modeling-xgb-hyperopt.ipynb**, which contains code for data processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning and modeling.
* The file **y_preds.csv**, which contains model predictions on the testset.
* The **databases**, which are in the input folder that was obtained from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS).

If you want to run the notebook from your computer, you will need to clone this repository.

We would also like to thank Professor **Sylvain Champonnois** for the support and knowledge they gave us.
